    /**
     * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
     * <p/>
     * The major things to dodge with Blackholes are:
     *   a) dead-code elimination: the arguments should be used on every call,
     *      so that compilers are unable to fold them into constants or
     *      otherwise optimize them away along with the computations resulted
     *      in them.
     *   b) false sharing: reading/writing the state may disturb the cache
     *      lines. We need to isolate the critical fields to achieve tolerable
     *      performance.
     *   c) write wall: we need to ease off on writes as much as possible,
     *      since it disturbs the caches, pollutes the write buffers, etc.
     *      This may very well result in hitting the memory wall prematurely.
     *      Reading memory is fine as long as it is cacheable.
     * <p/>
     * To achieve these goals, we are piggybacking on several things in the
     * compilers:
     * <p/>
     * 1. Superclass fields are not reordered with the subclass' fields.
     * No practical VM that we are aware of is doing this. It is unpractical,
     * because if the superclass fields are at the different offsets in two
     * subclasses, the VMs would then need to do the polymorphic access for
     * the superclass fields.
     * <p/>
     * This allows us to "squash" the protected fields in the inheritance
     * hierarchy so that the padding in super- and sub-class are laid out
     * right before and right after the protected fields.
     * <p/>
     * We also pad with "int"-s so that dense layout in superclass does not
     * have the gap where runtime can fit the subclass field.
     * <p/>
     * 2. Compilers are unable to predict the value of the volatile read.
     * While the compilers can speculatively optimize until the relevant
     * volatile write happens, it is unlikely to be practical to be able to stop
     * all the threads the instant that write had happened.
     * <p/>
     * This allows us to compare the incoming values against the relevant
     * volatile fields. The values in those volatile fields are never changing,
     * but due to (2), we should re-read the values again and again.
     * <p/>
     * Primitives are a bit hard, because we can't predict what values we
     * will be fed. But we can compare the incoming value with *two* distinct
     * known values, and both checks will never be true at the same time.
     * Note the bitwise AND in all the predicates: both to spare additional
     * branch, and also to provide more uniformity in the performance.
     * <p/>
     * Objects should normally abide the Java's referential semantics, i.e. the
     * incoming objects will never be equal to the distinct object we have, and
     * volatile read will break the speculation about what we compare with.
     * However, smart compilers may deduce that the distinct non-escaped object
     * on the other side is not equal to anything we have, and fold the comparison
     * to "false". We do inlined thread-local random to get those objects escaped
     * with infinitesimal probability. Then again, smart compilers may skip from
     * generating the slow path, and apply the previous logic to constant-fold
     * the condition to "false". We are warming up the slow-path in the beginning
     * to evade that effect.
