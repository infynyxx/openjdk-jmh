     * Since @State objects are kept around during the lifetime of the benchmark,
     * it helps to have the methods which do state housekeeping. These are usual
     * fixture methods, you are probably familiar with them from JUnit and TestNG.
     *
     * Fixture methods make sense only on @State objects, and JMH will fail to compile
     * the test otherwise.
     *
     * As with the State, fixture methods are only called by those benchmark threads
     * which are using the state. That means, you can operate the thread-local contexts,
     * (don't) use synchronization as if you are executing in the context of benchmark
     * thread.
     *
     * Note: fixture methods can also work with static fields, although the semantics
     * of these operations fall back out of State scope, and obey usual Java rules (i.e.
     * one static field per class).

     * You can see measureRight() yields the result, and measureWrong() fires
     * the assert at the end of the run.
